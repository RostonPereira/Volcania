        Policy may be superseded by expressly designated legal notices or terms located 
        on particular pages within this Site. Dispute Resolution; Arbitration Agreement. 
        We will work in good faith to resolve any issue you have with the Site, 
        including products and services ordered or purchased through the Site, if you 
        bring that issue to the attention of our customer service department. However, 
        we realize that there may be rare cases where we may not be able to resolve an 
        issue to a customer's satisfaction. You and Volcania Automobiles agree that any 
        dispute, claim or controversy arising out of or relating in any way to your use 
        of the Site, including products and services ordered or purchased through the 
        Site, shall be determined by binding arbitration instead of in courts of general 
        jurisdiction. Arbitration is more informal than bringing a lawsuit in court. 
        Arbitration uses a neutral arbitrator instead of a judge or jury, and is subject 
        to very limited review by courts. Arbitration allows for more limited discovery 
        than in court, however, we agree to cooperate with each other to agree to 
        reasonable discovery in light of the issues involved and amount of the claim. 
        Arbitrators can award the same damages and relief that a court can award, but in 
        so doing, the arbitrator shall apply substantive law regarding damages as if the 
        matter had been brought in court, including without limitation, the law on 
        punitive damages as applied by the INDIA's Supreme Court. You agree that, by 
        agreeing to these Terms of Use, the INDIA.
 
 
        Federal Arbitration Act governs the interpretation and enforcement of this 
        provision, and that you and Volcania Automobiles are each waiving the right to a 
        trial by jury or to participate in a class action. This arbitration provision 
        shall survive termination of these Terms of Use and any other contractual 
        relationship between you and Volcania Automobiles. If you desire to assert a 
        claim against Volcania Automobiles, and you therefore elect to seek arbitration, 
        you must first send to Volcania Automobiles, by certified mail, a written Notice 
        of your claim ("Notice"). The Notice to Volcania Automobiles should be addressed 
        to: General Counsel, Volcania Automobiles, Inc., 3700 W. Juneau Ave., Milwaukee, 
        WI 53208 ("Notice Address"). If Volcania Automobiles desires to assert a claim 
        against you and therefore elects to seek arbitration, it will send, by certified 
        mail, a written Notice to the most recent address we have on file or otherwise 
        in our records for you. A Notice, whether sent by you or by Volcania 
        Automobiles, must (a) describe the nature and basis of the claim or dispute; and 
        (b) set forth the specific relief sought ("Demand"). If Volcania Automobiles and 
        you do not reach an agreement to resolve the claim within 30 days after the 
        Notice is received, you or Volcania Automobiles may commence an arbitration 
        proceeding or file a claim in small claims court. During the arbitration, the 
        amount of any settlement offer made by Volcania Automobiles or you shall not be 
        disclosed to the arbitrator. You may download or copy a form Notice and a form 
        to initiate arbitration from the American Arbitration Association at 
        www.adr.org. If you are required to pay a filing fee, after Volcania Automobiles 
        receives notice at the Notice Address that you have commenced arbitration, it 
        will promptly reimburse you for your payment of the filing fee, unless your 
        claim is for more than INDIAN Rs:100,000. The arbitration will be governed by 
        the Commercial Arbitration Rules and the Supplementary Procedures for Consumer 
        Related Disputes (collectively, "AAA Rule") of the American Arbitration 
        Association ("AAA"), as modified by these Terms of Use, and will be administered 
        by the AAA. The AAA Rules and Forms are available online at www.adr.org, by 
        calling the AAA at 1-800-778-7879, or by requesting them from us by writing to 
        us at the Notice Address. The arbitrator is bound by the terms of these Terms of 
        Use. All issues are for the arbitrator to decide, including issues relating to 
        the scope and enforceability of these Terms of Use, including this arbitration 
        agreement. Unless Volcania Automobiles and you agree otherwise, any arbitration 
        hearings will take place in the county (or parish) of your billing address. (If 
        you reside outside of the United States, any arbitration hearings will take 
        place in your country of residence at a location reasonably convenient to you, 
        but will remain subject to the AAA Rules including the AAA rules regarding the 
        selection of an arbitrator). If your claim is for INDIAN Rs:100,000 or less, we agree that you may choose whether the arbitration will be conducted solely on
         the basis of documents submitted to the arbitrator, through a telephonic hearing, or by an in-person hearing as established by the AAA Rules. If your claim 
         exceeds INDIAN Rs:100,000, the right to a hearing will be determined by the AAA Rules. Regardless of the manner in which the arbitration is conducted, the 
         arbitrator shall issue a reasoned written decision sufficient to explain the essential findings and conclusions on which the award is based. If the arbitrator
        issues you an award that is greater than the value of Volcania Automobiles’s last written settlement offer made before an arbitrator was selected (or if Volcania
        Automobiles did not make a settlement offer before an arbitrator was selected), then Volcania Automobiles will pay you the amount of the award or 
        INDIAN Rs:100,000, whichever is greater. Except as expressly set forth herein, the payment of all filing, administration and arbitrator fees will be governed by
         the AAA Rules. Each party shall pay for its own costs and attorneys' fees, if any. However, if any party prevails on a statutory claim that affords the 
         party attorneys' fees, or if there is a written agreement providing for payment or recovery attorneys’ fees, the arbitrator may award reasonable fees to the 
        prevailing party, under the standards for fee shifting provided by law. 
 
YOU AND Volcania Automobiles AGREE THAT EACH MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY IN YOUR OR ITS INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY, AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER 
IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING. Further, unless both you and Volcania Automobiles agree otherwise, the arbitrator may not consolidate more 
than one person's claims with your claims, and may not otherwise preside over any form of a representative or class proceeding. The arbitrator may award declaratory
 or injunctive relief only in favor of the individual party seeking relief and only to the extent necessary to provide relief warranted by that party's individual claim.
If this specific provision is found to be unenforceable, then (a) the entirety of this arbitration provision shall be null and void, but the remaining provisions of these 
Terms of Use shall remain in full force and effect; and (b) exclusive jurisdiction and venue for any claims will be in INDIA...
